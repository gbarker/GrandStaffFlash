User Story for Grand Staff Flash Cards:

As a piano player I need to learn to recognize and identify notes on the grand staff instantly. I would like a flash card application that will help me to do that. 

The application should present me with a note on the grand staff and give me a multiple choice interface consisting of the letters A-G. I should also be required to toggle sharp, flat, or natural.

The note presented on the grand staff should include a key signature and time.

Wrong answers should result in that same card being shown again randomly within 3 to 8 iterations.

Ideally the application will broken into a generic module for managing the flashcards, and a separate module specific to grand staff flash cards. In the future we can re-use the generic flashcard module for creating additional modules for multiplication, vocabulary, color theory, etc. 

A further development would be to provide a "flashcard builder" interface where users could construct cards themselves.
